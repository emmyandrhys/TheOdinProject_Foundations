    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Writing with this red homemade ink is said to bring forth wishes.</p>
    <p>Dove’s Blood ink is traditionally used for spells involving love, desire, blessings, reconciliation, friendship and loyalty.  It’s also used to seal pacts and promises. Its magickal heritage stretches back to Ancient Greece when a pair of doves (Her favorite bird) would be sacrificed to Aphrodite by love petitioners. Dove’s Blood ink is attributed to Venus. Usually it is a dark pink or red ink with essences of Venus herbs (e.g. Rose, Jasmine, or Geranium).</p>
